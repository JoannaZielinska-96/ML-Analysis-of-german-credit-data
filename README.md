# Analysis of german credit data

## Project purpose
The german credit data contains financial and banking details of customers.
The given dataset contains information about individuals who have applied for credit from a bank.
Each entry in the dataset represents a person, and they are classified as either good or bad credit risks based on their attributes.
The task involves predicting whether the customer will repay a credit.

The aim of the project was to perform exploratory data analysis of german credit data.
The goal of the EDA was to gain knowledge about the features that influence credit repayment.

Two models were trained as part of this project:

- Logistic regression (machine learning algorithm used for solving binary classification problems)
- Decision Tree (machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression problems)

Both algorithms were then evaluated using selected metrics, based on which both models were compared with each other.
